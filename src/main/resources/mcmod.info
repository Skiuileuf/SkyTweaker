  "description": "Adds extra capabilities to CraftTweaker, such as item cooldowns. To use import \"import mods.skytweaker.Cooldown;\" in your zenscript, then Cooldown.setCooldown(IPlayer, IItemStack, lenInSeconds as float);. You can also use Cooldown.getCooldown(IPlayer, IItemStack), which returns a float. This mod also adds the /cooldown command (/cooldown set <targets> <item> <seconds> OR get <targets> <item>), which requires admin rights.",
